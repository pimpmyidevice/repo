		<h2 role="header">1.2 (April 12, 2020)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				• Improve detection of what tweaks inject into a process even more<br>
				• Change dylib name from "000_Choicy.dylib" to "   Choicy.dylib" (3 spaces), now loads even earlier<br>
				• If Choicy isn't loading first, only grey out the tweaks that load before it instead of disabling the configuration altogether
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 role="header">1.1.4</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				• Improve detection of what tweaks inject into a process even more<br>
				• Don't show 'not loading first' error on substitute based jailbreaks, as this is only an issue with Substrate<br>

			</li>

		<ul>
			<li>
				• Fix tweak lists being empty in some cases (mainly on 32 bit devices)<br>
				• Work around an issue with unc0ver on A12 that would cause a lock up when getting the contents of the /usr/libexec by using a different method for it. Unc0ver will receive a fix for this in the future too.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 role="header">1.1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				• Add an option for global tweak configuration (with options for process specific backlists/whitelists to overwrite the global one)<br>
				• Daemons that no tweak injects into are automatically hidden now<br>
				• 'Recommeded Daemons' are determined at runtime now by checking if they link against UIKit (previously this used to be a hardcoded list of daemons)<br>
				• Process specific tweak lists should now be 100% correct (uses a mach-o / dyldSharedCache parser internally)<br>
				• Add a section for hidden applications at the bottom of the application list<br>
